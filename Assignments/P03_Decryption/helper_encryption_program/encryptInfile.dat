HI MY NAME IS RYKIR EVANS AND I AM A COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATH DOUBLE MAJOR. I AM CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN DISCRETE
STRUCTURES, AND I AM MAKING AN ENCRYPTION PROGRAM FOR OUR PROGRAM THREE ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS TO ASSIST THE DECRYPTION
PROGRAM THAT WE WERE TASKED WITH MAKING WHICH USES FREQUENCY DECRYPTION TO DETERMINE THE MOST USED LETTER IN A
MESSAGE AND MATHEMATICALLY MANIPULATES THE ASCII VALUES USING NUMERICAL SHIFT TO DECRYPT THE MESSAGE. WHILE WE WERE
PROVIDED WITH A SAMPLE INPUT FILE, TO TRULY TEST OUR PROGRAM, WE SHOULD ALWAYS COME UP WITH OUR OWN INPUT SET TO
FURTHER TEST THE RELIABILITY OF OUR PROGRAM#
THIS STRING TRIES SPECIFICALLY TO STOP THE PROGRAM FROM WORKING, MAKING LIMITED OCCURENCES OF THE ALPHABET SYMBOL E, 
IN SPITE OF HOW MANY WORDS INCLUDE THIS SYMBOL, THIS STRING DILUTES THE RATIO BY INCLUDING WORDS THAT HAVE LONGER SPANS 
TO SPECIFICALLY OUTWEIGH THE AMOUNT OF OCCASIONS THAT E WILL SHOW UP UNAVOIDABLY WHILE ALSO USING A SIZABLE STRING#
TO FURTHER ENSURE THE PROGRAM WILL WORK UNDER A VARIETY OF TEST CONDITIONS THE NEXT MESSAGE WILL USE A AND E EQUALLY,
SPECIFICALLY TEN OF THE LETTER A FOLLOWED BY TEN OF THE LETTER E, FOLLOWING THAT MESSAGE, ONE THAT WILL MAKE USE OF 
E AND F EQUALLY SHALL BE USED, SPECIFICALLY TEN OF THE LETTER E FOLLOWED BY TEN OF THE LETTER F. THIS IS TO TEST WHAT 
WILL HAPPEN IN THAT PARTICULARLY RARE CIRCUMSTANCE, BUT THIS THIRD MESSAGE SHALL ACT AS THE FINAL RANDOM TEST#
AAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEE#
EEEEEEEEEEFFFFFFFFFF#
