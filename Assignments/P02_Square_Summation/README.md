## Program 2 - Square Summation
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

This program reads from an input file to test how many total squares can be formed out of an NxN grid of squares, where N is from the input file. The program displays calculations from 3 different ways of calculating the problem, but these will be equal.

### Files

|   #   | File                                        | Description                                              |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [main.cpp](./main.cpp)                       | Main driver of my project that calls helper functions    |
|   2   | [Feynman.dat](./Feynman.dat)                | Input file containing test cases for N                   |
|   3   | [output.dat](./output.dat)                  | Formatted output file based on input file                |

### Instructions

Fill out `Feynman.dat` or use prefilled numers. Run the program using `./main` and the program will prompt the user for file names, upon which it will use whatever is typed in. For the first prompt, the user should type `Feynman.dat`, and for the second prompt, the user should type `output.dat`.
The user will then find the output file containing a table displaying N on the far left column. The following 3 columns display different ways to calculate the summation of squares, but they will be equal.
