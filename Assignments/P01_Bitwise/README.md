## Program 1 - HighestBit
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

This program reads in a list of integers and does bitwise manipulation to achieve the index of the highest set bit within any integer. It proceeds to modify the original number by setting the next highest bit to a 1 using logical OR and displays the original integer, the index of it's highest bit, and the modified integer to an output file.

|   2   | [HighBits.dat](./Assignments/HighBits.dat)  | Input file containing integers                           |
|   3   | [Output.dat](./Assignments/Output.dat)      | Formatted output file based on input file                |

### Instructions

Fill out `HighBits.dat` or use prefilled numers. Run the program using `./main` and the file will automatically be referenced.
You will find the output file containing the original integer, the index of it's highest set bit, and a hypothetical number if the next highest bit were set to 1.
